<!--paragraph,     strong,mark,em,i,del,ins,sub,sup,small-->
<p><strong>Favoritism</strong> in the workplace is exactly what it sounds like: <ins>favoring someone not because he or she is doing
a great job</ins>, but for reasons <sub>outside of the job performance</sub>. For instance,
a manager consistently <sup>offers an employee</sup> the best and most <em>highly-regarded projects</em>, 
even though <small>that employee does not perform</small> well enough to <mark>deserve them</mark>. Or <i>perhaps an employee</i> is 
offered a <del>promotion over someone</del> else who has been at the company longer and has more experience.</p>
