<h2 style="color:pink;"> Objective</h2>
<p>By understanding microbes, microbiologists aim to solve a<br>
 range of problems affecting our health, the environment, climate and food and agriculture. 
 This can include the prevention, <br>
 diagnosis and control of infections and disease, as well as ensuring that food is safe, 
 understanding the role that microbes play in climate change, and developing green technologies.<br>

As a microbiologist, you'll focus on the biology of microorganisms at both the molecular and cellular level, 
as well as their ecology, including viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and protozoa<br>.</p>

<h2 style="color:pink;"> Work Experience</h2>
<p>Having experience in a laboratory is useful when applying for jobs.<br> If your degree doesn't include a year out in industry or research, consider taking a research project over the summer.

A number of organisations provides a limited number of grants for undergraduates wanting to get hands on experience, including the Microbiology Society.<br>

Student membership of a professional body such as the Microbiology Society or the SfAM will show your commitment and provide valuable networking and career development opportunities<br>.</p>
